# Recruitment Management App

Recruitment-focused sample app built with Next.js App Router and TypeScript.

This app is designed to be managed by the Sandbox Platform (control panel), similar to other sample target apps, while keeping all product functionality within the recruitment domain.

## Scope

- Job requisition management
- Candidate pipeline tracking
- Interview scheduling board
- Live dashboard metrics
- User-facing careers portal
- Protected admin operations console

## Architecture

The app is organized by intent using Next.js route groups:

- `src/app/(public)` for role entry and sign-in routes
- `src/app/(workspace)` for recruiter and candidate workspace screens
- `src/app/api` for route handlers

Shared UI and behavior live in:

- `src/components/layout` for app shell and navigation framing
- `src/components/auth` for reusable login form behavior
- `src/lib` for auth utilities and data-store logic

Styling uses a custom design system in `src/app/globals.css` (no Tailwind CSS).

## Local development

1. Copy the environment template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3002
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3002`.

## Experience split (for demos)

- Role selector on first load: `/`
- User login: `/user-login`
- Admin login: `/login`
- Recruitment operations UI (shared dashboards/pages): `/jobs`, `/candidates`, `/interviews`
- User-facing careers portal: `/careers`, `/careers/apply`
- Admin console: `/admin`, `/admin/jobs`, `/admin/candidates`, `/admin/interviews`

Admin and user routes are protected by proxy route guards and require their respective auth cookies.

Recruiter operation routes are also protected:

- `/jobs`
- `/candidates`
- `/interviews`

Configure credentials in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) using:

- `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `AUTH_USER_EMAIL`
- `AUTH_USER_PASSWORD`

Login forms are prefilled with development defaults for quick demos.

To use your own credentials, update `.env` values and restart the app.

## Data model

Data is stored in `data/recruit.db` (SQLite via `better-sqlite3`). Tables:

- **jobs** — requisitions with status, department, location
- **candidates** — pipeline entries linked to jobs with stage tracking
- **interviews** — scheduled interviews linked to candidates and jobs

Foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE`: deleting a job removes its candidates and their interviews automatically.

## Data Seeding

- `npm run seed` creates `data/recruit.db` with Faker-generated data
- On `npm start`, `scripts/entrypoint.js` seeds automatically if the DB does not exist
- Set `SEED_COUNT` env var to control how many candidates are generated (default: 30)
- Set `SCENARIO_CONFIG` as JSON to override individual seed parameters (e.g. `{"candidate_count":50,"job_count":10}`)
- `SCENARIO_CONFIG` keys take precedence over `SEED_COUNT`

## Recruitment API endpoints

- `GET/POST /api/jobs`
- `PATCH/DELETE /api/jobs/:id`
- `GET/POST /api/candidates`
- `PATCH/DELETE /api/candidates/:id`
- `GET/POST /api/interviews`
- `PATCH/DELETE /api/interviews/:id`
- `GET /api/metrics`

## Auth endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/user-login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SEED_COUNT` | Number of candidates to seed | `30` |
| `SCENARIO_CONFIG` | JSON override for seed parameters | — |
| `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Admin login email | `admin@example.com` |
| `AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login password | `change-me-admin-password` |
| `AUTH_USER_EMAIL` | User login email | `user@example.com` |
| `AUTH_USER_PASSWORD` | User login password | `change-me-user-password` |

## Build check

npm run build
```
